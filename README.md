# DEPRECATED - ember-square-payment-form

**⛔️ The "Square Payment Form" is deprecated, and will no longer be supported aside from critical bug fixes. Please use the [Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/overview) to take payments on a web client.**

The Square Payment Form Ember addon lets you take payments securely and easily
in your Ember app using a familiar, component-based syntax.

_Note: this SDK is in beta. We'll be improving it as we work towards GA - please
leave feedback for our team!_
